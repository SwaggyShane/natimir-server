## Core Game Loop

1. **Turns** regenerate at +7 every 25 minutes (max 400 stored)
2. Spend turns to: build, research, hire, attack, cast spells, send expeditions
3. Engineers build continuously based on allocation — no turn cost per building
4. Gold is produced each turn based on land × tax × economy research × race bonus
5. Support units (researchers, engineers, scribes) are housed in their buildings and pay no upkeep
6. All units gain XP from activity, levelling up to provide up to +50% effectiveness at level 100
7. Races unlock a unique racial bonus when their signature unit reaches level 5

---

## Turn Economy

**Gold per turn** (baseline: 404 land, 42% tax, 100% economy research):

| Race | GC/turn |
|---|---|
| Dwarf | 457 |
| Orc | 418 |
| High Elf | 399 |
| Human | 399 |
| Dark Elf | 342 |
| Dire Wolf | 266 |

## Building Tool System

Three types of construction tools are produced in smithies:

| Tool | Source | Cap | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hammers** | Smithy (1 turn) | 25/smithy | +5% build speed each, degrade after 20 turns of use |
| **Scaffolding** | Smithy (1 turn + 2,500 GC) | 10/smithy | Required for >100t buildings; speed bonus for <100t buildings |
| **Blueprints** | Library (scribes) | 25/smithy | Required for 100t+ buildings; also drop from dungeons (20%) |

---

## Expedition Rewards

Gold formula: `rangers × 12 × tacBonus × raceBonus × rangerLevel × turns × rand(1.05–1.30)`

| Type | Turns | Map drop | Blueprint drop |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scout | 10 | 5% | — |
| Deep | 25 | 15% | — |
| Dungeon | 50 | 25% | 20% |

Ultra-rare prizes: 0.5% chance on deep, 1% on dungeon. The Throne of Nazdreg Grishnak has a 0.1% chance on deep/dungeon and can only be found once across the entire server.

## Special: The Throne of Nazdreg Grishnak

A tribute to a real player. The throne exists once in the entire game world and can never be found again once discovered.

>
> "An orc who sat upon this throne once commanded armies and shaped the world.
> His name is remembered. His legacy endures."

When found, every kingdom receives a news event and a global chat broadcast. The finder receives all stats +100, 1,000,000 gold, 1,000 land, 100,000 population, +50 morale, and 50,000 fighters.
